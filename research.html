<h1>Research</h1>
My career has allowed me to focus on a variety of research interests, most of them stemming from my work as a research and instruction librarian. These concepts are presented here with more information about the deliverables I have created as part of each overarching topic. 

 <h2>Information Behaviors of SGM Individuals in Substance Use Recovery Programs</h2>
  <p>In my doctoral research, I explored the sense-making behaviors of sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals pursuing remission from substance use disorder, with a particular interest in the impact of minority stress on these behaviors. To conduct my research, I applied a transformative framework to collecting and analyzing oral histories within an SGM-affirming twelve-step program community. </p>
