<h1>Teaching Statement</h1>
  <p>In the corridor of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Library hangs a sign summarizing
Louis Agassiz’s approach to learning: “Study nature, not books.” When first encountering this
adage, I thought Agassiz’s view was antithetical to my pedagogy, but as I began teaching
students and researchers within a library, then moved into instruction in more formal classrooms
as a non-tenure-track faculty member, his statement became central to my own teaching
philosophy. While reading can teach us a great deal, including empathy, actively working in a
field leads to experience and knowledge. Though I incorporate Agassiz’s idea into my pedagogy,
it is through education that I seek to dismantle the white supremacist perspective with which he
evaluated the world.</p>
<p>My teaching philosophy is holistic, and I view education as an ecosystem, with teaching and
learning inexorably intertwined. I teach in order to help students mature via meaningful
experiences as individuals in service to the world. I believe that, through education, people
develop reflective thinking, which allows them to critically engage with information and become
empathetic contributors to the global conversation. Likewise, I believe teachers must remain
open to learning opportunities while advancing scholarship. Education is, at its heart, a
collaborative operation. My goal as an instructor is to help learners develop the skills they need
to succeed on their discerned paths, an objective that includes helping them be able to actively
engage in their own educational process. I aim to teach empathy by exposing students to various
viewpoints and experiences, as well as recognition of their own expertise. I ask them to consider
user perspectives; for example, in a community where researchers are wary of using digital
publishing tools, how can we encourage consensus while respecting the reticent users’ concerns?</p>
<p>From my classroom experience and academic research, it has become apparent that students gain
a great deal from evaluating and assessing their own work, as well as the work performed by
their peers and instructor. For this reason, I ask students to write evaluations for themselves, their
classmates, and myself. These evaluations are anonymous, which is meant to encourage honest
feedback. Using these reports, I tailor the course to address knowledge gaps while allowing
students to explore their own interests. When assessing students, I focus on their mastery of a
topic rather than their comparison with other learners. I assess student knowledge at the
beginning of an educational endeavor, reassess throughout the learning experience, and
summatively assess at the conclusion.</p>
<p>To ensure accessibility within the classroom, I first make sure students know their well-being is
paramount and encourage them to reach out to me with any accommodations they need, whether
or not these are formally documented. I also work with student accessibility services, as well as
educational technology and information literacy professionals, to ensure students have access to
support. I clearly define the course objectives and assignments, and I consider class
demographics and attempt to engage each student one-on-one. When possible, I flip the
classroom, allowing digital elements to give students background information that they can then
use to participate in face-to-face discussions and activities, which often encourages students to
model new ideas. I endeavor to create an inclusive environment where students feel comfortable
acknowledging their needs and empowered in their learning environments.</p>
<p>Just as my students are on a lifelong journey of learning and growth, so am I. As my experiential
and scholarly knowledge continues to develop, so shall my teaching philosophy. For now, my
pedagogical practices are based in the holistic environment of an educational ecosystem where
students and instructors share the experience of active learning. I aim to continue making my
teaching student-focused to help create a better-educated population of professionals who can
critically reason and demonstrate their skills in meaningful ways that impact them far beyond
their time in my classroom.</p>
