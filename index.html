      <p>
In my daily life, I work in roles devoted to education, metaliteracy, and information behavior. Currently, I am the STEM Librarian at Northeastern University, an affiliated faculty member in the Writing, Literature, and Publishing Department at Emerson College, and an adjunct professor in the School of Library and Information Science at Simmons University. My professional background includes teaching and design for digital publishing, information literacy, and scholarly communications, as well as developing digital repositories. I've also conducted research and provided instruction in digital humanities and research data management.

     <p>
In my research, I focus on oral histories of sexual and gender minority individuals pursuing remission from substance use disorder. I've also investigated the use of AI chatbots in mobile applications for mental health as well as other topics in library and information science and academic publishing. 
</p>
      <p>
When away from screens and classrooms, I enjoy distance running, wildlife photography, performing improv comedy, reading, and attending concerts and theatrical productions.
