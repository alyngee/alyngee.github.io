      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>This is the personal website of Dr. Alyn Gamble, an information professional, educator, content creator, and researcher currently based in Boston, Massachusetts. I am non-binary and use <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/singular-they"> they series pronouns</a>. On this site, I hope to gather some of my experiences in a fully accessible format. Please let me know if you notice any errors or have any questions.

In my research, I focus on oral histories of sexual and gender minority individuals pursuing remission from substance use disorder. I've also investigated the use of AI chatbots in mobile applications for mental health as well as other topics in library and information science and academic publishing.

In my daily life, I am the STEM Librarian at Northeastern University and an affiliated faculty member in the Writing, Literature, and Publishing Department at Emerson College. My professional background includes work in digital publishing, information literacy, and scholarly communications, as well as developing digital repositories. I've also conducted research and provided instruction in digital humanities and research data management.

When away from screens, I enjoy running, birding, performing improv comedy, reading, and attending concerts and theatrical productions.
